    <description>This project is a convex hull algorithm and library for 2D,  3D, and higher dimensions. The code can also be used to compute Delaunay triangulations and Voronoi meshes of the input data. The benchmarks indicate that the convex hull code and 4 and higher dimensional triangulation code is on par or better than the solution provided by the C++ library CGAL.
The code is written in C# 4.0 and provides a template based API that allows extensive customization of the underlying types that represents vertices and faces of the convex hull. The algorithm itself is technically an implementation of the QuickHull algorithm. Nevertheless, it's not just a simple port of QHull as a different approach and data structures are used in the MIConvexHull algorithm.</description>
